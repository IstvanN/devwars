MÃ¶thGames proudly presents: DevWars, an interactive, turn-based web application where you can create your own developer character, and fight other developer characters with skills, items, weapons etc.

This application was made during the FedEx Day at Green Fox Academy. The first version of our game can be found [here.](http://devwars.herokuapp.com)
