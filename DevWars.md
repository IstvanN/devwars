## DevWars

### What should happen
- Hot seat
- Build character page
- Fight: action-point based (AP is one, everything costs 1 AP)
- 

### Backend - Spring Boot App

- Basics: MySQL database in background
- Models
- Services
- Repositories
- Controllers

### Frontend - Thymeleaf

- Login ?
- Security ?
- Hot Seat vs P2P

### Creative stuff brainstorming
- Races: only one choosable (*Toj√°s, *Indian youtuber)

- Frontend design idea: should be based on Pokemon (retro graphics, lot of stuff we can use from the Internet)

- Character creation: should look like CV, pre-given choosable skills
- Based on technologies taught in GFA (otherwise, there would be too many options)
- Sections: 
	- Basic info: name, age (if you choose vim, it will set it to 35, while if you choose JS, it will set it to 21)
	- Stats: HP, AP (action points), IQ
		- These are modified by skills chosen, i.e. choosing Mac will increase you action points but lower your IQ
		- or choosing 
	- Programming languages
		- Java
		- JS
		- C
		- Python
	- used OS
		- Windows (not choosable)
		- Mac
			- increases AP (cause it's quick)
			- decreases IQ
		- Linux
			- increases IQ
			- decreases HP
	- Technologies
		- Spring
		- Angular
		- NodeJS
		- React
		- Thymeleaf
		- AutoCAD (or other C stuff I don't know)
		- Selenium
	- Language skills
		- German
		- English

- Character classes: Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Tester, Data Scientist
- Class-specific attacks:
	- Hello World-attack for everyone
	- STDOUT attack
	- Backend: Bootstrap design (usable against Frontend class), 
	- Frontend: CSS Grid,  
	- DevOps: Git Commit Suicide
	- Tester: All tests fail, 
	- Data Scientist: Big Data
